## About

Primary goals are to build services using the most appropriate stack with accessibility and user experience at the centre. 

Current area of work is building Design Systems to provide a consistent, performant and accessible front end to multiple services. Testable code using modern coding techniques.

I'm a great communicator who advocates for design consistency, standards and accessibility across organisations
